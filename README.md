                           ##SBI LIFE INSURANCE HACKATHON

This platform is designed to detect fraudulent activities by leveraging advanced **Machine Learning** techniques. It is deployed on Vercel and consists of a robust backend that handles **fraud classification** and **Signature Similarity Matching** through **Similarity Score**. The system verifies whether a given signature belongs to the original person or is a **Forgery**.
